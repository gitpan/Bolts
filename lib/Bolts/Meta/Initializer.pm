=head1 NAME

Bolts::Meta::Initializer - Store a path and parameters for acquisition

=head1 VERSION

version 0.142930

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an initializer, which is just a path and set of parameters used to make a call to L<Bolts::Role::Locator/acquire> within a L<Bolts::Role::Initializer> for any attributed tagged with the C<Bolts::Initializer> trait.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 path

This is the path that is passed into the constructor.

=head2 parameters

This is a reference to the hash of parameters passsed into the constructor (or an empty hash if none was passed).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $init = Bolts::Meta::Initailizer->new(@path, \%parameters);

The C<BUILDARGS> for this object has been modified so that the constructor takes arguments in the same form as L<Bolts::Role::Locator/acquire>.

=head2 get

    my (@path, \%parameters) = $init->get;

Returns the contents of this object in a form that can be passed directly on to L<Bolts::Role::Locator/acquire>.
