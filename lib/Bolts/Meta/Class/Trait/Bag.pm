=head1 NAME

Bolts::Meta::Class::Trait::Bag - Metaclass role for Bolts-built bags

=head1 VERSION

version 0.143170

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While a bag may be any kind of object, this metaclass role on a bag provides some helpful utilities for creating and managing bags.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 artifacts

These are the artifacts that have been added to this bag. It is saved as a hash. You can get the hash of artifacts as a list using C<list_artifacts>. You add artifacts to this list using L</add_artifact>.

=head2 such_that_isa

This is a L<Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint> to apply to the L<Bolts::Artifact/isa_type> of all contained artifacts.

=head2 such_that_does

This is a L<Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint> to apply to the L<Bolts::Artifact/does_type> of all contained artifacts.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 is_finished_bag

    my $finished = $meta->is_finished_bag;

This is used to determine if a bag's definition has already been performed and completed. At this time, it's just a synonym for L<Class::MOP::Class/is_immutable>.

=head2 add_artifact

    $meta->add_artifact(name => $artifact, {
        isa  => $isa_type,
        does => $does_type,
    });    

Adds an artifact method to the bag with the given C<name>. The C<$artifact> may be an instance of L<Bolts::Role::Artifact>, a code reference to used to define a L<Bolts::Artifact::Thunk> or just another value, which will be wrapped in an anonymous sub and turned into a L<Bolts::Artifact::Thunk>.

The C<isa> and C<does> will be applied to the artifact as appropriate.

=head2 finish_bag

    $meta->finish_bag;

This completes the bag building process and marks the Moose object as immutable. Aft this is called, L</is_finished_bag> returns true.
