=head1 NAME

Bolts::Blueprint::Factory - Build an artifact by calling a class method on a class

=head1 VERSION

version 0.143170

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bolts;

    # Using the usual sugar...
    artifact thing1 => ( # construct via MyApp::Thing->new(...)
        class => 'MyApp::Thing',
    );

    artifact thing2 => ( # construct via MyApp::Thing->load_standard_thing(...)
        class  => 'MyApp::Thing',
        method => 'load_standard_thing',
    );

    # Or directly...
    my $meta = Bolts::Bag->start_bag;

    my $artifact = Bolts::Artifact->new(
        name      => 'thing',
        blueprint => $meta->locator->acquire('blueprint', 'factory', {
            class  => 'MyApp::Thing',
            method => 'new',
        }),
        scope     => $meta->locator->acquire('scope', '_'),
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most applications of Bolts will make a great deal of use of this. It allows you to use a class name and a class method name to construct an object. This is the most straightforward way of constructing things and the way most easily inferred from.

=head1 ROLES

=over

=item *

L<Bolts::Blueprint>

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 class

B<Required.> This is the name of the class to call the L</method> upon. This class will also be automatically loaded if it hasn't been loaded into the current Perl interpreter yet.

=head2 method

This is the method to call on the L</class>. Defaults to "new".

=head1 METHODS

=head2 builder

Loads the L</class> if it has not yet been loaded. Then calls the L</method> on it, passing through to the constructor whatever parameters were configured during pre-injection.
