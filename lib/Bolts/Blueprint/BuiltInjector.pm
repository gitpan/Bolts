Bolts::Blueprint::BuiltInjector - An injector-oriented builder using a subroutine

=head1 VERSION

version 0.142930

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bolts;

    # Using the usual sugar...
    artifact thing => (
        ...
        parameters => {
            thing => builder {
                my ($self, $bag, $name, %params) = @_;
                return MyApp::Thing->new(%params);
            },
        },
    );

    # Or directly...
    my $meta = Bolts::Bag->start_bag;

    my $artifact = Bolts::Artifact->new(
        ...
        injectors => [
            $meta->locator->acquire('injector', 'parameter_name', {
                key       => 'thing',
                blueprint => $meta->locator->acquire('blueprint', 'built_injector', {
                    builder => sub {
                        my ($self, $bag, $name, %params) = @_;
                        return MyApp::Thing->new(%params);
                    },
                }),
            }),
        ],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a blueprint for using a subroutine to fill in an injected artifact dependency.

This differs from L<Bolts::Blueprint::Built> in that it implements L<Bolts::Blueprint::Role::Injector>, which tags this has only accepting named parameters to the builder method, which is required during injection.
