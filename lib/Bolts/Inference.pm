=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the interface for Bolts inferrers. An inferrer is an object that is able
to examine a blueprint and from that blueprint determine what parameters,
settings, etc. the artifact constructed by the blueprint needs or may accept.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 infer

    my @parameters = $inferrer->infer($blueprint);

Given a blueprint, this must return a list of parameter descriptions, which are returned as a hash. Each element may contain the following keys:

=over

=item key

This is the name to give the parameter for injection.

=item inject_via

This is the full path to the injector to qcquire, found within the meta locator, usually L<Bolts::Meta::Locator>, usually under the "injector" key.

=item isa

This is the type constraint the injected value must adhere to.

=item does

This is the role type the injected value must adhere to.

=item required

This stats whether or not the parameter is required to complete the blueprint or not.

=back

Notice that the blueprint is not determined by the inferer. This is handled by L<Bolts::Artifact> instead, via the L<Bolts::Artifact/infer> setting on the artifact in question.
